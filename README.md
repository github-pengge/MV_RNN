# MV_RNN
A tensorflow implementation of Richard Socher's paper: Semantic Compositionality through Recursive Matrix-Vector Spaces

# Note
1. The parameters given in the files are not the best one. We are still working on finding better parameters.
2. I write the code based on code from stanford cs224d (assignment 3). So I use the same dataset as that one.
3. [TODO] There are still some tricks in the paper that I haven't applied in this implementation, such as word representation's initialization, training approach, etc.
